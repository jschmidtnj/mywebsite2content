# Factoryrobot 2.0

This summer (2019) I somehow managed to get an internship at Bell Labs in Murray Hill. For those of you who don't know, Bell Labs is an international research facility known for inventing the first transistor, developing Unix, and winning many Nobel prizes in the process. Interning there is a big deal. I was part of the BR Lab, which stands for BHAG (big hairy audacious goals) Realization lab (super-acronym, I know), and it is therefore focused on the most futuristic, long-term moonshot projects. It is similar to Google's X Labs. Bell Labs was split from AT&T in 1996 (antitrust laws) and added to Lucent, later merging with Alcatel to become Alcatel-Lucent, and then this merged company was bought by Nokia in 2016. So now Bell Labs does research under the umbrella and funding of Nokia, which is not really a phone company anymore, positioning itself instead as a networking solutions company. Nokia is pioneering 5G technology and IoT infrastructure, and in turn a lot of the technology Bell Labs is researching is focused on internet-connected, high-bandwidth, 5G and cloud solutions. In the BR lab, I was working on an autonomous robot, a robot that can map and navigate the world around it, and additionally can interact with physical objects using a forklift or other modular devices. It was using the local 4G LTE and 5G infrastructure, in addition to WiFi, along with local "edge cloud" solutions, to offload most of the computation.

## Design Challenge

To illustrate how Nokia's 5G networking products can be beneficial for a future workforce, Bell Labs designed an elaborate demonstration area, to be also used for testing their designs. One part of the area was the factory, where robots would coordinate to move multi-colored boxes around using small forklifts. When I started, these robots were already operational, but they were using an insufficient software stack. The original team that made these robots was just trying to meet a deadline and did not design for them to be high-performance and cooperative. Instead the robots moved in a choreographed sequence that could not be changed without intense software engineering effort. The challenge was to upgrade the software to use the autonomous navigation stack used by other robots in the demo area, allowing a user to tell the robot to move to a certain location on the map, and the robot plans a route to get there.
